# Registration-Form
I built this project for a college web design course during the Spring 2019 semester.

This project features:
- Performing a validation test on the selection of the conference session package and the conference discount number
- Calculating the cost of the registration and saves data in session storage
- Writing data values from session storage into the registration summary form

To run the project: 
- Open the mas_register.html file
- Fill out the information as instructed
- Click "continue."

The program will validate that you entered all the correct information, calculate your total based off that information, and display the results on the following screen.
